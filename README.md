# Algorithms

Various algorithms demonstrating concepts I learned in school

## Week1

Constant, Linear, and Quadratic algorithms
  Week1.cs contains 3 methods that all have different runtimes.
  They all print things to the console, using different loops.

## Week2

Shuffling an array using Fisher-Yates Shuffle
  Week2_Fisher-Yates Shuffle.cs is my implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle.
  For every element in the array, the algorithm picks a pseudo-random index of the array, and swaps it with the current.

## Week3

Data Structures: Array, Map, Stack, Queue
  Week3_DataStructures.cs has a few examples of different data types in action.
  For game development, I mostly use arrays and dictionaries, and stacks and queues have niche uses in other applications.

## Week4

Sorting Algorithms
  BubbleSort - Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case
  
  InsertionSort - Runtime: best case is O(n), and worst case is O(n2)
  
  SelectionSort - Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case
